<p>Addressing your concerns and providing clarity is a priority in your journey towards gynecomastia surgery. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions to help you make informed decisions:</p>
<h3 id="what-causes-gynecomastia"><strong>What causes gynecomastia?</strong></h3>
<p>Gynecomastia can result from various factors, including hormonal imbalances, genetics, certain medications, and underlying health conditions. This condition leads to the enlargement of male breast tissue, causing physical and emotional discomfort. Gynecomastia surgery can address this issue by reducing excess tissue and restoring a more masculine chest appearance.</p>
<h3 id="is-gynecomastia-surgery-safe"><strong>Is gynecomastia surgery safe?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, gynecomastia surgery is generally safe when performed by a skilled and experienced plastic surgeon. Prior to the procedure, a thorough assessment of your medical history and overall health will be conducted to ensure your suitability for surgery. I take all necessary precautions to minimize risks and complications, making your safety and well-being a top priority.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-recovery-process-like"><strong>What is the recovery process like?</strong></h3>
<p>The recovery process after gynecomastia surgery typically involves some discomfort and swelling, which can be managed with prescribed medications.

<h3 id="are-the-results-permanent"><strong>Are the results permanent?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, the results of gynecomastia surgery can be permanent as long as a stable weight is maintained. The excess glandular tissue and fat removed during surgery do not usually grow back. However, it&rsquo;s essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle to ensure the longevity of your results.</p>
